        <p>
            Hi and welcome to my plant shop. Down below you'll find an overview of all of my favourite plants.
            If you can't find a specific plant, why not use <i>google</i> to find it and add it to the list!

            By now you know already what my top 3 favourite plant is, but I also really want to show them and give you more information on them!
            See below my cool plants! 
            They all need a lot of sun light and care, so I have put them all in places around the house where they are the happiest and can grow and grow.
            Once a month they also get a special treat; I add some plant vitamins when watering them

            <p>A banana plant houseplant offers interesting foliage and white flowers emerging from purple buds. Keep in mind that while some banana tree varieties produce edible fruit, others do not—like that of Musa basjoo. Therefore, be sure to look into the type of indoor banana tree you have or want to ensure that it will accommodate your needs and vice versa
